# Packer Block

The `packer {}` block contains settings for Packer, including the specification of a required Packer version.

Within this block, you will also find the `required_plugins` section, which lists all the plugins necessary for the template to build your image. Although Packer is distributed as a single binary, much of its functionality depends on plugins. Some plugins—such as the Docker Builder you will use—are developed, maintained, and distributed by HashiCorp, while others can be created by anyone.

Each plugin block includes a `version` and a `source` attribute. Packer uses these attributes to download the appropriate plugins. The `source` attribute is only needed when you require a plugin from outside the HashiCorp domain. For a complete list of official HashiCorp and community-maintained builder plugins, please refer to the [Packer Builders documentation](https://www.packer.io/docs/builders).

While specifying the `version` attribute is optional, it is recommended to constrain the plugin version to ensure compatibility with your template. If no version is specified, Packer will automatically download the latest version during initialization.

# Source Block

The `source` block configures a specific builder plugin, which is then invoked by a `build` block. It leverages builders and communicators to determine the type of virtualization, how to launch the image for provisioning, and how to connect to it. Builders and communicators are configured together within a source block, which can be reused across multiple builds. A single build can reference multiple sources.

Each `source` block is identified by two labels: a **builder type** and a **name**. These labels uniquely reference the source when it is later used in build configurations.

For example, in the template below, the builder type is **docker** and the name is **ubuntu**:

```hcl
source "docker" "ubuntu" { 
  image  = "ubuntu:jammy"
  commit = true
}
```

In this configuration, the Docker builder creates a new Docker image using `ubuntu:jammy` as the base image and then commits the container as an image. The communicator (such as `ssh` or `winrm`) defines how Packer connects to the machine.

# Build Block

The `build` block defines the steps Packer will execute after launching the Docker container.

In the example below, the build block references the Docker image defined in the source block above (`source.docker.ubuntu`):

```hcl
build {
  name    = "learn-packer"
  sources = [
    "source.docker.ubuntu"
  ]
}
```

# Managing the Image
Packer only builds images. It does not attempt to manage them in any way. After they're built, it is up to you to launch or destroy them as you see fit.
